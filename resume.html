                    <h4>PT Profesional Telekomunikasi Indonesia</h4>
                    <h5>Jakarta, Indonesia</h5>
                    <p>During my internship at PT Profesional Telekomunikasi Indonesia (Protelindo), I was assigned to the Information
                         Technology Division to develop a predictive machine learning model aimed at identifying customer churn. 
                         I worked with a massive dataset of over 87 million records, performing extensive data cleaning, joining, 
                         and filtering using Python (pandas). My analysis focused on customer timelinesâ€”from initial onboarding to 
                         various service status changes like "in progress," "on hold," "completed," or "canceled." Based on this, 
                         I engineered features and built a classification model that achieved 82% accuracy in predicting churn. 
                         This project not only deepened my technical skills in data handling and machine learning but also showed me 
                         how data can directly support retention strategies and business outcomes.</p>

                    <h3>Data Engineer, Analytics Internship</h3>
                    <p>July 2022 - August 2022</p>
                    <h4>Maybank</h4>
                    <h5>Bandung, Indonesia</h5>
                    <p>At Maybank Indonesia, I joined the IT and business analysis team to help improve the mobile banking experience.
                         Recognizing customer dissatisfaction with the existing app, I designed and distributed a survey to collect 
                         user feedback. After cleaning and analyzing the responses, I discovered a key issue: many users were struggling
                          with the app due to limitations on low-end smartphones, which are common in Indonesia. Based on these insights,
                        I proposed a "lite" version of the mobile app focused on core functionalities such as checking balances, 
                        sending money, and requesting payments. This experience taught me the importance of user-centered design, 
                        and how data-driven recommendations can influence product strategy in a large financial institution.</p>
